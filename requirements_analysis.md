## Framework Selection Considerations

The application requires:
- Rich UI components for text editing and outline management
- Efficient state management
- API integration capabilities

Based on the available templates mentioned in the knowledge module:
- **React** with create_react_app would provide good component libraries (shadcn/ui) and visualization tools (Recharts)
- **Next.js** would provide additional server-side capabilities and built-in database support through Cloudflare Workers

The choice between these frameworks will depend on whether server-side processing and database persistence are critical requirements for the application.
