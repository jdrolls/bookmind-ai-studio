- [ ] View project listing
- [ ] View project details
- [ ] Update project information
- [ ] Delete a project

### 2. Keyword Generation
- [ ] Generate keywords using AI
- [ ] Add custom keywords manually
- [ ] Remove keywords
- [ ] Verify keywords are saved with the project

### 3. Outline Generation

- [ ] Analyze writing style
- [ ] View style profile
- [ ] Verify style sample is saved with the project

### 5. Chapter Editing
- [ ] Generate chapter content
- [ ] Edit chapter title and summary
- [ ] Edit chapter content
- [ ] Save chapter changes

### 6. Bulk Generation
- [ ] Trigger bulk generation of all chapters
- [ ] Monitor progress indicator
- [ ] View generated chapters
- [ ] Navigate to individual chapters

### 7. Marketing Content Generation
- [ ] Generate book summary
- [ ] Generate chapter summaries
- [ ] Generate author bio
